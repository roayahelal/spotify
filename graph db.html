            <p id = "graph-paragraph"> Music production in the past decade faced a challange refered to as 'the loudness war'. Spotify has recodnized this and added extra measure to prevent music released to be competing by loudness. 
                This graph is a perfect represnation of this story; most popular songs have their loudness as -5 dB which is the general volume of the song whereas Spotify sets a limit of -14LUFS of loudness before applying methods to reduce the volume on the streaming platform. LUFS can be seen as the absolute value of loudness throught the song from highest points to lowest points; -5 dB overral can easily be converted double of that in LUFS (-10) which is below Spotify's limit to not have the audio file modified in any way and be released as is. 
                Another factor to consider is how most poplar songs have most likely been mastered in the same state-of the art music studios and mastering engineers who follow the same cristeria.
